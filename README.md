# road-to-devops


The goal of this project is to learn programming fundamentals(specifically kotlin) and at the same time
applying devops practices. To achieve that, I will make a rest api using Kotlin/Spring whose endpoints 
corresponds to a programming/kotlin concept. For example /coroutine will be an endpoint that shows the
things we learn about coroutines.

RULES:
 - at lest 1 commit per day
 - no lazy commits such as a README change
 - have a specific goal per commit
 - The project has no deadline but I want to finish this within 2 months.
 - Remind me in April 2, 2024

# Roadmap
## 1. Preperation/Relearning
### 1.1 Software Production
- [Software Development Life Cycle](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/dynamic-devops-roadmap/blob/main/content/01-module.md#12-software-production---software-development-life-cycle)
- Change Management
- MVP(Minimum Viable Product) mindset
- Documentation Basics
### 1.2 Brush up knowledge of Programming fundamentals
- Kotlin
- Data Structure & Algorithms
- CPU & Memory
- etc.
### 1.2 Devops
- [Devops Core](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/dynamic-devops-roadmap/blob/main/content/01-module.md#15-devops-methodology---devops-and-devsecops-core-pillars)

## 2. Planning
In this phase we shall plan all the next phases for this project from the application to its deployment and beyond. The plan is only to treated as a guide and never as the final product. It must be flexible to changes.
